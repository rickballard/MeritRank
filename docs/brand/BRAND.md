# Digital Halo — Brand Notes

**Canonical line:**  
**Your digital halo — verifiable kudos, not callouts.**

**Why it works**
- Puts the emphasis on *kudos / positive proof*, not allegations.
- “Tamper-evident” is accurate; “optionally chain-anchored” is forward-compatible.
- Clear trust & safety stance (no smears; disputes/opt-out encouraged).

**Safe-claims guardrails**
- Prefer **tamper-evident** over “immutable.”
- Say **optionally anchored to public chains** unless anchoring is default.
- No accusations or smears; support dispute/opt-out flows.

**Alt taglines**
- *Build your digital halo.*
- *Impact receipts you can cite.*
- *Proof of contribution, not a gossip feed.*
- *A positive, tamper-evident ledger of good work.*
