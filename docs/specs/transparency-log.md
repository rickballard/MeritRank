# Transparency Log & Anchoring (v1 stub)

- Append-only Merkle tree (CT-like)
- Batch anchor roots to public chain (OpenTimestamps/EVM L2)
- Admin actions logged; signed releases; snapshots/checkpoints
- No PII on-chain; proofs reference encrypted blobs only

_TODO_: data structures, anchoring cadence, audit workflow.
